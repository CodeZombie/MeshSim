Make Entity a base class that others can inheret from.
    give it base methods like
        update()
        draw()
        isOnPoint(x,y)
        isColliding(other_)
        

Simplify the graphics class a bit by using the setStyle method with {style} objects

Get rid of all "createX()" methods. Replace them all with addX(new X())).


Go for a more modular approach.
    Entity will contain:
        A Shape() object that acts as a bounding box for colliisions
        A Sprite object, which will be a new class, and
        the Draw() method can choose to draw it, something else, or not at all.
